Version 0.2.2

Simplified the syntax for shock plots (`shockplot = TRUE` is no longer necessary) and decreaseed the font size.

Version 0.2.1

Added a `shockplot` to `dynsimGG`. This allows you to include a plot of one shock variable's fitted values below the main prediction plot.

`num` argument added to `dynsim` allowing the user to specify how many simulations to run at each point in time.

Fixed simpler `scen` objects.

Minor documentation fixes.
