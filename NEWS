Version 0.3

The package is now referred to as `Dynsim` and the main simulation command as `dynsim`. This is to make it consistent with `Zelig`s naming conventions.

Note: this will break code created with version 0.2.

`num` argument added to `dynsim` allowing the user to specify how many simulations to run at each point in time.

Minor documentation fixes.
